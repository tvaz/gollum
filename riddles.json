	"What has roots as nobody sees,\nIs taller than trees\nUp, up it goes,\nAnd yet never grows?":
	"Mountain",
	"Voiceless it cries,\nWingless flutters,\nToothless bites,\nMouthless mutters.":
	"Wind",
	"It cannot be seen, cannot be felt.\nCannot be heard, cannot be smelt.\nIt lies behind stars and under hills,\nAnd empty holes it fills.\nIt comes first and follows after,\nEnds life, kills laughter.":
	"Dark",
	"Alive without breath,\nAs cold as death;\nNever thirsty, ever drinking,\nAll in mail never clinking.":
	"Fish"
